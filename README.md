# ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, Iâ€™m `Ifeanyi Christwin Jr`
<img src='https://github.com/iChristwin/iChristwin/blob/main/Ifeanyi%20next%20to%20battery%20stack.jpg?raw=true'>

I am a Machine Learning Engineer specialized in Business Analytics and Intelligence Management. I also have professional interest in subjects of Thermodynamics and Informatics.

I advocate the adoption of soft energy paths, access economies, and veganism for the environment.

I founded [Switch Electric and Gas Ltd](https://www.linkedin.com/company/whynotswitch/), a data-driven energy company, with the goal of decentralizing the energy infrastructure in Africa and reducing it's carbon footprint. Our business model entails generating and retailing low-cost electricity on-site using Distributed Energy Resources (DER), such as solar PVs, in conjunction with energy storage technologies. Consequently avoiding the huge economic and sociopolitical costs of centralized power plants.

As the Founder and CEO of [Switch Electric and Gas Ltd](https://www.linkedin.com/company/whynotswitch/), I am responsible for strategic direction, business development, technology and operations of the company. I have also developed a proprietary data analytics system with machine learning algorithms capable of analyzing electricity supply and consumption data in real time.

I am also a community manager at [Techniverse.org](https://www.linkedin.com/company/techniverse), an initiative aimed at creating the space for undergraduate students in Nigeria to meet, learn, network and build sustainable relationships in the world of technology.
